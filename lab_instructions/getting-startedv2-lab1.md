# Create and Deploy a Document Intelligence Custom Model

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 hour

## Overview

In this lab focuses on creating and utilizing a custom Document Intelligence solution in Azure to analyze and process documents effectively. The implementation includes resource setup, model training, pipeline integration, and search optimization.

## Objective

Understand how to create and deploy an Azure AI Document Intelligence custom model in Azure, train data, and configure Azure AI Search.

**Create and Deploy a Document Intelligence Custom Model:** Understand how to streamline document data extraction and enhance efficient information retrieval by creating an Azure AI Document Intelligence resource, training data, building a custom model pipeline in BPA, and configuring Azure AI Search.

## Pre-requisites

- Familiarity with Azure’s suite of AI tools.

- Basic knowledge of BPA and how to build and manage data processing pipelines.

## Architecture

The architecture leverages Azure Document Intelligence for document analysis and data extraction. A custom project is set up with storage for training data, and the trained model is integrated into a Business Process Automation (BPA) pipeline. Azure AI Search connects to Azure Blob Storage, creating an index and indexer for efficient data processing and search. This setup enables seamless document processing, automation, and advanced search capabilities.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Azure Document Intelligence:** Enables advanced document processing and analysis by creating and configuring a custom project with training data stored in Azure Blob Storage.

- **Azure Blob Storage:** Serves as the repository for storing training and test documents required for model training and evaluation.

- **Business Process Automation (BPA):** Integrates the trained custom model into workflows using the Custom Model module, automating document processing tasks and improving operational efficiency.

- **Azure AI Search:** Connects to the Blob Storage data source, enabling indexing and search capabilities. 

## Getting Started with Lab

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) and lab guide will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab. You can see the number on the bottom of the lab guide to switch to different exercises of the lab guide.
